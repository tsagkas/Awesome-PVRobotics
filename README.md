Pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) are reshaping the landscape of robotic control by moving beyond the traditional tabula-rasa paradigm, where visuo-motor policies are trained from scratch. By leveraging powerful pre-trained foundation models from the domain of vision, researchers can harness rich, high-level abstractions to accelerate training and improve the generalization of robot policies across diverse environments. This repository compiles pioneering research on how PVRs are being utilized to enhance control learning and robotic performance without relying on task-specific or in-domain data.
